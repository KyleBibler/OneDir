README for DjEXAMPLE Directory
==============================

This directory contains files that displays an attempt at using the Django framework in Python.
Most of the files are created as overhead by Django when you initiate a project.
Modifications were made to the database to include two classes User and File.
These classes contain fields relevant to the project, but no instances of these classes were added into the database.
This directory is intended ONLY to tinker around with Django, and to analayze whether this Framework is useful to us.
